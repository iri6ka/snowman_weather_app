17-18 Dec 2020
For a few days I have been reasearching ways how to implement weather api for my application. As I came across OpenWeather API, I was planning to use it normal way at the beginning. However then I came across OpenWeather Ruby Client and decided to use that one. It seemed to be much simpler to implement this data and it was more straighforward. I managed to run a few error tests and now if the input of city and country don't match in the exsting list of countries and cities, it returns an error message.

CODE!!!!!!!!

After receiving commentary from teachers based on my presentation, I decided to focus on the mvp and make sure that the core application runs without implementing major sprinkles.

After consulting educators, I needed to save my api_key in external file and then parse it to the main file. I ran a few tests in a separate file and it returned the required key to me, however it didn't run in the main file. I would appreciate to get some commentary on the best way to parse it to the index.rb file so I know for the future.
